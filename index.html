							<p></strong> The beauty industry is a vast and exciting field that encompasses a wide range of products and services designed to help people look and feel their best. From makeup and skincare to haircare and fragrance, there are so many different areas to explore within the industry. Therefore, I am deeply passionate about the beauty industry and have always been fascinated by the way it empowers individuals to express themselves. Additionally, there's also a growing emphasis on inclusivity and diversity within the industry, which has opened up new opportunities for people from all backgrounds to participate and contribute to its growth. Whether an individual is interested in pursuing a career in the industry or simply exploring it as a hobby, there's always something new and exciting to discover.
							<p> I was particularly drawn to L'Oréal Vietnam because of its reputation as a leading company in the beauty industry and its commitment to innovation and sustainability. I believe L'Oréal Vietnam could be a great place to start if I want to pursue a career in the beauty industry. The company offers a wide range of opportunities for professionals at all levels, from entry-level positions to senior management roles. Additionally, working for a company with a strong commitment to sustainability and innovation can be highly rewarding and fulfilling.
							<p>	Through my previous experience conducting scientific research on consumer behavior, I have gained valuable skills in sales, business operations, and marketing, which I believe would be an asset to L'Oréal Vietnam. I am excited about the opportunity to work with a team of like-minded individuals who are dedicated to making a positive impact in the world through beauty and innovation.</p>

							<h2>Please pick your favorite L'Oréal brand, tell us what you think the brand stands for and how the brand appeals to its target consumers</h2>

						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p> One of my favorite L'Oréal brands is Maybelline - a makeup brand that aims to empower women to express themselves through vibrant, bold, and innovative products. The brand is known for its high-quality, affordable makeup that is accessible to women of all ages and backgrounds. At its core, Maybelline stands for self-expression and inclusivity. The brand believes that makeup is a tool for women to express their individuality and creativity and that everyone should have access to high-quality products that help them look and feel their best. Maybelline's tagline, "Maybe she's born with it, maybe it's Maybelline," has become iconic in the beauty industry. 
							</p>
							<p>Maybelline appeals to its target consumers in several ways. 
								Firstly, the brand offers a wide range of high-quality, affordable makeup products that are designed to meet the needs of women of all ages and backgrounds. Maybelline understands that its customers have different preferences and needs when it comes to makeup, so it offers a diverse range of products to cater to those needs.
								Secondly, Maybelline is known for its innovative and trend-setting products. The brand is constantly coming up with new and exciting makeup products that appeal to its target consumers. For example, Maybelline's Superstay Matte Ink liquid lipstick was an instant hit with consumers due to its long-lasting and comfortable formula.
								Thirdly, Maybelline has a strong social media presence and engages with its customers through various social media platforms. The brand uses social media to showcase its products, share makeup tips and tutorials, and connect with its customers on a personal level. This helps to build a strong relationship between the brand and its customers, which in turn helps to increase brand loyalty.

							<h2>What do you think that could be the new beauty trend or new beauty channel arising in Vietnam in the next 2 years</h2>
							<p></p>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p><strong></strong>  Based on the current state of the Vietnamese beauty industry, there are a few potential trends or channels that could emerge in the next two years:</p>

									<div class="content">
									<h3>Skinimalism</h3>
									<p>Skinimalism, a minimalist approach to skincare that emphasizes simplicity and natural beauty, is a beauty trend that has been gaining popularity around the world in recent years, and it's expected to continue to be a major trend in Vietnam for the next few years due to several factors. Firstly, Vietnamese consumers are becoming more aware of the importance of skincare and are looking for ways to take care of their skin in a simple and effective way. Secondly, the climate in Vietnam is hot and humid, which can make heavy skincare routines uncomfortable and impractical. Skinimalism offers a way to take care of the skin without being weighed down by heavy products. Skinimalism in Vietnam is all about achieving healthy and glowing skin with minimal effort. This means that skincare routines will be simplified, with fewer products and steps. Instead of relying on a long list of products, consumers will focus on using high-quality, multi-tasking products that can address multiple skin concerns at once.</p>

									</header>
								<div class="content">
								
									<h3>Using skincare tools at home</h3>
									<p>With advances in technology, consumers are now able to access professional-grade skin care treatments from the comfort of their own homes. Home skin care equipment includes devices such as facial cleansing brushes, LED light therapy devices, microcurrent devices, and more. These devices offer a range of benefits, including deep cleaning, exfoliation, and anti-aging effects. One of the main reasons why home skin care equipment is becoming more popular in Vietnam is its convenience. Many consumers don't have the time or resources to visit a professional spa or salon regularly, so using home skin care equipment allows them to achieve similar results from the comfort of their own homes. Another reason why home skin care equipment is becoming more popular is due to its affordability. While professional-grade skin care treatments can be expensive, many home skin care devices are now available at affordable price points, making them accessible to a wider range of consumers.</p>
